Dear grader,

I'm very sorry to inform you that I tried using two different approaches to make you a convenient seed file. Sadly, for whatever strange reason, the seed file would not work. As such, you will have to manually put in the data yourself. Luckily, the website's create, edit and delete functions are totally working. As such, you will not have any issues exploring the site, you will just have to put some dummy data in yourself.

Sincerest apologies,
Anna
